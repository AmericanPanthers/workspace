It is time to unite, and American Panthers are here to provide a safe platform
for healing and cooperation. We must carefully evaluate different viewpoints and
make every effort to find the middle ground. We encourage healthy debate from
this middle ground--not from the extremes.

Above all else, our goal is to enable safe and effective communication between
groups of people who would not typically mix.
