Aside from showing that it was booted at least once, Tails OS is designed to start
completely fresh every single time it is turned on. The only exception is a
``~/Persistent`` folder, which was encrypted with the password you chose.

To resume:

1. Boot to Tails OS on Flash Drive (see Initial Setup)
2. Provide decryption password (admin password not needed)
3. Run bash ~/Persistent/workspace (or right-click and ‘Run as a Program’)
