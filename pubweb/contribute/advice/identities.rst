About Online Identities
=======================

[why we need to protect safety--without accusatory language]
[why anonymity becomes required in a tyrannical government--first they came]
[organize and discuss is separate from actual action]

You should create a brand new online identity, completely separate from any other online
or real identity. You may be known by as many of these online identities (personas) as
you choose to create, but trust will be built on the actions of each individual identity.

Let us illustrate:

=========  ===========  ======================
Real Name  Online Name  Known For
=========  ===========  ======================

If you choose to create multiple accounts, we recommend :ref:`creating a unique
<workspace>` for each identity. 

Handling Bad Actors
-------------------

We accept that not all bad actors can be removed and we understand that any
communication may be made public. We cannot always remain anonymous, however this
anonymity is how we remain safe against physical violence.

.. admonition:: "And they will know we are Christians by our love"
   :class: quote

   "A new command I give you: Love one another. As I have loved you, so you must love one another. By this everyone will know that you are my disciples, if you love one another."

   -- `John 13:34-35 <https://www.bible.com/bible/111/JHN.13.NIV>`__

While we remove bad actors, when they become known, this is reactionary. We must
be proactive. Please consider the following tips:

- Keep this identity unique from every person you know, in real life
- Only build trust through online interactions!
- The online persona you create must avoid sharing any personal information
