Our Tools
=========

**TODO:** Explain why and provide references for:

- Tails OS
- Tor Network
- Atomicmail: Supports captcha-only account registration
- Git (VCS): Decentralized "version control system" that supports secure sharing
- SSH: The standard "key/lock" solution for open source
   - You can freely share the public key with anyone
   - Anyone can grant access...to that public key (not "you")
   - Your password-protected "private" key can then unlock the door
- GPG: The standard "identity" solution for open source
   - Used to create "digital signature" that proves your ownership of a virtual identity
   - Supports a "web of trust" that allows trusted members to show their trust for other members
   - The web allows us to quickly remove multiple bad actors
- GitHub: Amazing anti-spam without requiring a phone number
- Gitlab: Similar to GitHub
