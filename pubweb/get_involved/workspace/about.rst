Our Shared Workspace
====================

.. admonition:: **Don't Panic** We can communicate safely; we have the technology.
   :class: note

   At first, there is no anonimity. Your visit to this site has likely
   been logged in an NSA database. It is important to understand this, but
   it is not a reason for fear.

With so many options, it's hard to know which technology is the right tool
for the job, and it is scary to not fully understand how safe you truly are.

[why open source]
[this is **our** actual solution]

Why It Exists
-------------

Our ``Shared Workspace`` solution is designed to address your safety concerns,
so that you can communicate openly. We hope that building this solution in
the open will make it easy to follow along, and to "**trust but verify**."

Please take a moment to look through the list of :ref:`our tool choices <advice-tools>`
to understand why we selected this software and what additional steps you can
take to become confident in the security they provide...when used correctly.

How It Works
------------

Although this process may seem daunting, at first, our goal is to walk you
through it and explain anything important.

This process is broken down into four sections:

1. :ref:`Obtain Physical Hardware <workspace-phys>`: This is the equipment you will need
2. :ref:`First-Time Setup <workspace-create>`: Step-by-step instructions to copy our setup
3. :ref:`Your Identity <workspace-ident>`: It's unfortunately required, but does keep you safe
4. :ref:`Future Reboots <workspace-usage>`: Pick up where you left off, and general use

What You Need
-------------

This is the "physical hardware" that you need in order to copy our solution:

1. Your own laptop, or old desktop: Nearly any "PC" sold since 2010 is perfect.
2. USB Flash Drive: Key words to search for include ``USB3.1`` and ``400MB/s``.
    - 32 GB is **plenty**, and 256 GB is excessive
    - Example: https://www.amazon.com/dp/B0D2ZL574W
3. An internet connection is required--we cannot collaborate in isolation.
4. YubiKey (Optional, but highly encouraged)

Only the Flash Drive and YubiKey need to be kept safe; the laptop is just a vessel.
