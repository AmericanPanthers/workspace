Empowering Communities
======================

To stand up against oppression effectively, a community needs more than just a
shared belief--it needs common goals and structure.

Awareness and Education
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

* Conduct "know your rights" workshops.
* Map out how systemic racism manifests locally (e.g., redlining, school funding).
