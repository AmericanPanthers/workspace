Our Core Values
===============

We believe in a government **for the people, by the people, and of the people**--with
life, liberty, and justice for all. We oppose authoritarianism, systemic racism, unjust
laws, and systemic oppression.

Our mission is a return to these core values, which have been eroded by centuries of
exploitation and injustice, and to empower communities to stand up against oppression
and fight for a more equitable society.

These values are not new or unique. They are the **foundation of human dignity and
freedom** that countless men and women have died to protect. They are the principles
that define:

- **Our** `Constitution of the United States

- UN's `Universal Declaration of Human Rights

   **We do not succeed by leaving anyone behind.**

Measure of Success
------------------

When a government rules **for** the people, citizens welcome the grant of authority.

Our task is not to invent these value; it is to continue the work of those who
came, fought, and died before us. We must strive against injustice.

We measure the health of our government and society against three pillars:

.. _life:

Life: Protection and Well-Being
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

**Does the government protect the physical well-being of all people?**

A caring society ensures the people have:

- Access to quality healthcare
- Clean water
- Nutritious food
- Breathable air
- Safe communities
- Affordable housing

When marginalized communities face higher mortality rates or lack access to
life-sustaining resources, we have failed **the people**.

.. _liberty:

Liberty: Freedom to Thrive
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

**Does the government ensure people have resources to pursue their potential?**

A free society ensures:

- Quality education
- Liveable wages
- Education that enables people to understand and exercise their rights

TODO-remove: Failure: Freedom is a luxury available only to those with wealth or status.
When freedom TODO-missing

.. _justice:

Justice: Equitable Systems
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

**Is the legal system a tool for equity or a weapon of control?**

A just system requires:

- Accountability when those in power fail to serve
- Transparent application of laws to all people equally
- Corrective measures when systemic bias is identified
- Protection of individual rights regardless of background
- Laws that reflect the will and dignity of the people

When the law protects an "elite ruling class" while punishing "outsiders,"
there is no justice for **the people**.
