It is time to unite, and American Panthers are here to provide a safe platform
for healing and cooperation.

.. admonition:: "Fear is the basis of every tyranny." ~Vladimir Lenin
   :class: warning

   - Do not let yourself be ruled by fear!
   - Do not become complacent to the suffering of your neighbor!
   - Do not remain divided!

Above all else, our goal is to enable safe and effective communication between
groups of people who would not typically mix. We must carefully evaluate different
viewpoints and make every effort to find the middle ground. We encourage healthy
debate from this middle ground–not from the extremes.
