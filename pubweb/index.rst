**American Panthers stand for Life, Liberty, and the pursuit of Happiness.**

Every day, the political system becomes more entrenched in partisan warfare.
The needs of the people are being ignored in favor of corporate lobbying and
special interest groups that marginalize fellow americans.

   - **Do not** let yourself be ruled by fear!
   - **Do not** become complacent to the suffering of your neighbor!
   - **Do not** remain divided!

Before we can fix what's wrong, ***we need to agree on what is right***:

1. Consider :ref:`where you stand <your-stance>`
2. Review :ref:`our position on important matters <values>`
3. If you agree, :ref:`get involved <contribute>`

**Our Question to You:** Why are we forced to choose between two extremes that do not represent the needs of the people?

Look Forward
------------

- Are you frustrated with people actively harming fellow americans?
- Are you tired of people screaming about being outraged?
- Have you given up on protests that lead nowhere?
- Do you think it's finally time to do something?

**Our Movement is not left or right--it is forward.**

It's time to break the binary. We need to challenge the conventional notions
of left and right, of red vs. blue. The system has been a tool for division,
manipulation, and power hoarding.

We believe in the common good, in the shared humanity of all people. Democrat
vs. Republican is moot when neither serve the American people. Our mission is
simple: **Gain control of our rights, our freedom, and our unity.**
